<h1>Hello, Geeks!</h1>
<p>This group is to help people become better coders which, for most part is to get a job in software development. We focus on the FreeCodeCamp stack (JavaScript, HTML and CSS).We have a meetup every Saturday morning at the Edge SLQ Library. A relaxed, friendly environment were we can share knowledge and keep each other motivated.</p>
